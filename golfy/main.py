    ----
    num_peptides
        The number total number of peptides in the experiment

    max_peptides_per_pool
        Maximum number of peptides which can be in any one pool. This is also the number of peptides
        which will be in most pools if allow_extra_pools is False

    num_replicates
        Number of replicates in the experiment (i.e. how many distinct pools each peptide occurs in)

    num_pools_per_replicate
        Number of pools in each replicate. If None, then this will be set to the minimum number of pools
        required to fit all peptides. If an int, then this will be the number of pools in each replicate.

    invalid_neighbors
        List of peptide pairs which cannot be in the same pool

    preferred_neighbors
        List of peptide pairs which should be in the same pool if possible

    allow_extra_pools
        If True, then the solution can have more than the minimum number of pools required to fit all peptides. If False,
        then the returned solution may not be valid (i.e. some peptide pairs will occur in more than one pool together)

    verbose
        If True, then print out information about the solution as it is being constructed
